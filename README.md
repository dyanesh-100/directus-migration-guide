## ‚úÖ What Snapshot Covers

The `schema_snapshot.json` file includes:

* **Collections**: all custom and system collections schema
* **Fields**: definitions and configuration of each field
* **Relations**: relationships between collections

‚õî It **does NOT include** users, roles, policies, permissions, flows, operations, or actual data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Migration Process

Follow these steps **in order**, customizing bodies from the JSON files where needed:

---

### Step 1: Import Schema Snapshot

**Request:**

```
POST /schema/apply
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:** paste full `schema_snapshot.json`.

‚úÖ Sets up collections, fields, and relations.

---

### Step 2: Migrate Roles

**For each entry in `directus_roles.json`:**

```
POST /roles
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "2f24211d-d928-469a-aea3-3c8f53d4e426",
      "name": "Administrator",
      "icon": "verified_user",
      "description": "Admins have access to all managed data within the system by default",
      "children": [],
      "policies": [],
      "users": []
    }
  ],
  "meta": {}
}

```

‚úÖ Record the **new role IDs** for mapping later.

---

### Step 3: Migrate Policies

**For each in `directus_policies.json`:**

```
POST /policies
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "22640672-eef0-4ee9-ab04-591f3afb288",
      "name": "Admin",
      "icon": "supervised_user_circle",
      "description": null,
      "ip_access": null,
      "enforce_tfa": false,
      "admin_access": true,
      "app_access": true,
      "users": [
        "0bc7b36a-9ba9-4ce0-83f0-0a526f354e07"
      ],
      "roles": [
        "8b4474c0-288d-4bb8-b62e-8330646bb6aa"
      ],
      "permissions": [
        "5c74c86f-cab0-4b14-a3c4-cd4f2363e826"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "meta": {}
}

```

‚úÖ Map `roles` and `permissions` arrays to new IDs.

---

### Step 4: Migrate Flows

**For each in `directus_flows.json`:**

```
POST /flows
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "Map user to stakeholder apps",
  "status": "active",
  "trigger": "event",
  "accountability": "all",
  "options": {
    "type": "action",
    "scope": ["items.create"],
    "collections": ["directus_users"]
  }
}
```

‚úÖ Record each **new flow ID**.

---

### Step 5: Migrate Operations

**For each in `directus_operations.json`:**

```
POST /operations
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "Update matching stakeholders",
  "key": "update_matching_stakeholders",
  "type": "item-update",
  "position_x": 19,
  "position_y": 1,
  "options": { ... },
  "flow": "new-flow-id"
}
```

‚úÖ Map `flow` to the corresponding new flow ID. Record **new operation IDs**.

---

### Step 6: Attach Operations to Flows

**For each flow requiring an operation:**

```
PATCH /flows/{new-flow-id}
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{"operation": "new-operation-id"}
```

‚úÖ This links flow to its operations.

---

### Step 7: Migrate Permissions

**For each in `directus_permissions.json`:**

```
POST /permissions
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "collection": "customers",
      "action": "create",
      "permissions": {},
      "validation": {},
      "presets": {},
      "fields": []
    }
  ],
  "meta": {}
}
```

‚úÖ Map the `role` field to new ID. Ensure `collection` and `action` match schema.

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Final Notes

* Only include fields shown in examples‚Äîothers will cause errors.
* Request bodies must be copied exactly from JSON file templates.
* Always **track new IDs** manually for proper mappings.
* All endpoints and behaviors are verified per Directus docs.
* This process was tested end-to-end to ensure no errors.

---

Once complete, your new Directus instance will have **identical schema, roles, policies, flows, operations, and permissions** as your old instance‚Äîwithout migrating users or items.
