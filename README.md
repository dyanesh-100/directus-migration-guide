# 📦 Directus Migration Guide Through API

This guide enables you to migrate your Directus project schema, roles, policies, permissions, flows, and operations from an old instance to a new one using only API calls (Postman or any REST client). All request bodies reference JSON files in this repository—edit them as needed before running each step.

If any Doubt refer the official Directus docs: https://directus.io/docs/api

## ✅ What Snapshot Covers

The `schema_snapshot.json` file includes:

* **Collections**: all custom and system collections schema
* **Fields**: definitions and configuration of each field
* **Relations**: relationships between collections

⛔ It **does NOT include** users, roles, policies, permissions, flows, operations, or actual data.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Migration Process

Follow these steps **in order**, customizing bodies from the JSON files where needed:

---

### Step 1: Import Schema Snapshot

**Request:**

```
POST /schema/apply
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:** paste full `schema_snapshot.json`.

✅ Sets up collections, fields, and relations.

---

### Step 2: Migrate Roles

**For each entry in `directus_roles.json`:**

```
POST /roles
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "2f24211d-d928-469a-aea3-3c8f53d4e426",
      "name": "Administrator",
      "icon": "verified_user",
      "description": "Admins have access to all managed data within the system by default",
      "children": [],
      "policies": [],
      "users": []
    }
  ],
  "meta": {}
}

```

✅ Record the **new role IDs** for mapping later.

---

### Step 3: Migrate Policies

**For each in `directus_policies.json`:**

```
POST /policies
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "22640672-eef0-4ee9-ab04-591f3afb288",
      "name": "Admin",
      "icon": "supervised_user_circle",
      "description": null,
      "ip_access": null,
      "enforce_tfa": false,
      "admin_access": true,
      "app_access": true,
      "users": [
        "0bc7b36a-9ba9-4ce0-83f0-0a526f354e07"
      ],
      "roles": [
        "8b4474c0-288d-4bb8-b62e-8330646bb6aa"
      ],
      "permissions": [
        "5c74c86f-cab0-4b14-a3c4-cd4f2363e826"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "meta": {}
}

```

✅ Map `roles` and `permissions` arrays to new IDs.

---

### Step 4: Migrate Flows

**For each in `directus_flows.json`:**

```
POST /flows
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "Map user to stakeholder apps",
  "status": "active",
  "trigger": "event",
  "accountability": "all",
  "options": {
    "type": "action",
    "scope": ["items.create"],
    "collections": ["directus_users"]
  }
}
```

✅ Record each **new flow ID**.

---

### Step 5: Migrate Operations

**For each in `directus_operations.json`:**

```
POST /operations
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "Update matching stakeholders",
  "key": "update_matching_stakeholders",
  "type": "item-update",
  "position_x": 19,
  "position_y": 1,
  "options": { ... },
  "flow": "new-flow-id"
}
```

✅ Map `flow` to the corresponding new flow ID. Record **new operation IDs**.

---

### Step 6: Attach Operations to Flows

**For each flow requiring an operation:**

```
PATCH /flows/{new-flow-id}
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{"operation": "new-operation-id"}
```

✅ This links flow to its operations.

---

### Step 7: Migrate Permissions

**For each in `directus_permissions.json`:**

```
POST /permissions
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "collection": "customers",
      "action": "create",
      "permissions": {},
      "validation": {},
      "presets": {},
      "fields": []
    }
  ],
  "meta": {}
}
```

✅ Map the `role` field to new ID. Ensure `collection` and `action` match schema.

---

## ✔️ Final Notes

* Only include fields shown in examples—others will cause errors.
* Request bodies must be copied exactly from JSON file templates.
* Always **track new IDs** manually for proper mappings.
* All endpoints and behaviors are verified per Directus docs.
* This process was tested end-to-end to ensure no errors.

---

Once complete, your new Directus instance will have **identical schema, roles, policies, flows, operations, and permissions** as your old instance—without migrating users or items.
